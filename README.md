# Mothers-Day
This is my Mother's Day "card" for my wife. This woman is beyond anyone I've ever met in my life. From the day I met her, she has taken my two boys under her wing and have supported them and gave them the guidance they needed from a mother. Doing this while raising two of her own kids by herself is something I've never asked anyone to do. She's even supported me as I went through my web development schooling. This website is my dedication to her. It is simple now, but I do want to add a little more to it for styling purposes. 

This website is simple...just click the button to move to the next screen. When the "card" is finished, it will return to the start.
